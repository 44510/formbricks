#### Concepts

# Attributes?

Surveying your user base without segmentation leads to weak results and survey fatigue. Attributes help you segment your users into groups.

## What are attributes?

Attributes are key-value pairs that you can set for each person individually. For example, the attribute "Plan" can be set to "Free" or "Paid".

### How do attributes work?

Attributes are sent from your application to Formbricks and are associated with the current user. We store it in our database and allow you to use it the next time you create a survey.

### Why are attributes useful?

Attributes help show surveys to the right group of people. For example, you can show a survey to all users who have a "Plan" attribute set to "Paid".

## Setting attributes with code

One way to send attributes to Formbricks is in your code. In Formbricks, there are two special attributes for [user identification](/docs/attributes/identify-users)(user ID & email) and custom attributes. An example:

### Setting Custom User Attributes

You can use the setAttribute function to set any custom attribute for the user (e.g. name, plan, etc.):

<CodeGroup title="Setting Plan to Pro">

```javascript
formbricks.setAttribute("Plan", "Pro");
```

</CodeGroup>

Generally speaking, the setAttribute function works like this:

<CodeGroup title="Setting Custom Attributes">

```javascript
formbricks.setAttribute("attribute_key", "attribute_value");
```

</CodeGroup>

Where `attributeName` is the name of the attribute you want to set, and `attributeValue` is the value of the attribute you want to set.

## Identifying Users

At Formbricks, we value user privacy. By default, Formbricks doesn't collect or store any personal information from your users. However, we understand that it can be helpful for you to know which user submitted the feedback and also functionality like recontacting users and controlling the waiting period between surveys requires identifying the users. That's why we provide a way for you to share existing user data from your app, so you can view it in our dashboard.

Once the Formbricks widget is loaded on your web app, our SDK exposes methods for identifying user attributes. Let's set it up!

### Setting User ID

You can use the `setUserId` function to identify a user with any string. It's best to use the default identifier you use in your app (e.g. unique id from database) but you can also anonymize these as long as they are unique for every user. This function can be called multiple times with the same value safely and stores the identifier in local storage. We recommend you set the User ID whenever the user logs in to your website, as well as after the installation snippet (if the user is already logged in).

<CodeGroup title="Setting User ID">

```javascript
formbricks.setUserId("USER_ID");
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setting User Email

You can use the setEmail function to set the user's email:

<CodeGroup title="Setting Email">

```javascript
formbricks.setEmail("user@example.com");
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setting Custom User Attributes

You can use the setAttribute function to set any custom attribute for the user (e.g. name, plan, etc.):

<CodeGroup title="Setting Custom Attributes">

```javascript
formbricks.setAttribute("attribute_key", "attribute_value");
```

</CodeGroup>

### Logging Out Users

When a user logs out of your webpage, make sure to log them out of Formbricks as well. This will prevent new activity from being associated with an incorrect user. Use the logout function:

<CodeGroup title="Logging out User">

```javascript
formbricks.logout();
```

</CodeGroup>
